# NOTES
- Tommy Wiseau who was scheduled to come on the podcast once again cancelled.
- Ian the Intern’s Birthday! The entire crew gives Ian a 50$ Sharkies gift card as a joke.
- Dan plays the [[./Ian the Intern|Ian the Intern]] intro song for the first time on the show.
- Ian the Intern does the podcast’s first #PowerPoint - [[PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation about the Drake vs Pusha T beef. This would be very popular with the fans and would prompt the crew to turn it into a recurring segment.
- Ethan mentions that he wants to create an Ian the Intern song competition.
- *Ethan makes a bathroom comment*
