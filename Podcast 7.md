# NOTES
[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l65hR94nfqY) - This was the first LIVE show!
[[The Joji Incident|The Joji Incident]] - At one point Ethan states "in a natural setting, women are meant to be conquered". Joji cringes at this.
[[./Ghost Stories|Ghost Stories]] - In this episode Post discusses spooky instances that have occurred for him. This turned into Ethan asking every guest for awhile if they have any ghost stories.
