The [[Ethan Camera Angle|Ethan Camera Angle]] gag is a re-occurring joke of Podcasts always doing him dirting and giving him the worse possible camera angle, making him look even fatter than usualy. This happened on both [[Tiger Belly|Tiger Belly]] and [[Howie Mandel Does Stuff|Howie Mandel Does Stuff]].

As a gag, [[./Howie Mandel|Howie Mandel]] want to immortalize the angle and gave Ethan a pillow of it.
