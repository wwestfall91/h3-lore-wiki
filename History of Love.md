Love, AKA YungFika, was born on October 30, 2000 in Sweden. 
Before the Podcast
-------------------------------
We know a bit about his life before the podcast based on some of the stories he has told.

On [After Dark #70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_GoixIfwoY&t=8705s) love shares a story of when he was 9 years old. He and his friends threw pebbles at an abandoned house, only to find out that there was a strange old man living inside! He chased them down and dragged on of his friends back to his house before calling the police.

On [H3TV #28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pbu55cclU4&t=500s) love shares that when he was 15, he got caught up in the CS:GO fiasco. He became addicted and gambled away thousands of dollars in the process. Interestingly enough, this was a story that Ethan followed closely when it was happening, and made a [video on h3h3productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8fU2QG-lV0) about how awful the CS:GO situation was.

In November of 2019, love created H3 out of context, and began relentlessly pestering Ethans Twitter. Slowly but surely he began to amass quite the following. This eventually caught the eye of the crew, and Dan reached out stating that they were looking for a social media coordinator. 

Love quit his job, and was hired full time in [September of 2020](https://twitter.com/H3Out/status/1433185117195968513?s=20) 

Love Gets Hired
---------------------------------------------
While love was hired in September of 2020, he wouldn't appear on the podcast until nearly 4 months on [After Dark #17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSXkw0z2CIk&t=4210s), participating in a "simp off" against AB.

However, H3 Out of Context was mentioned a few times on the podcast before this. 
1. Hila was the first to mention him on [After Dark #6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfPmKCcl_Gg&t=2864s).
2. And a week later on [After Dark #7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uMN_NAThww&t=6619s) they watch a clip from his twitter about James Charles stealing Teddy Fresh designs. 
*If you're unfamiliar with the James Charles drama that was happening at this time, Ethan and Hila break it down in [After Dark #5](https://youtu.be/ccLvagZRlAg?t=65).)

2021
---------
2021 was a HUGE year for Love as he solidified himself on the Podcast. Being that he was in Sweden, it forced the crew to get a little bit creative on how to incorporate him into the show. And so, Love Bot was born!

Love Bot
-----------------
Love Bot was a $4000 robot that the crew bought so that love could navigate his way around the office. It debuted on [Off the Rails #1](https://youtu.be/JHGs0juAZX4?t=1) and helped solidify the vibe that Off the Rails was going for when [Love Bot and The Gatsby faced off in a 1-on-1 battle](https://youtu.be/JHGs0juAZX4?t=3195). https://youtu.be/JHGs0juAZX4?t=3195

*The Gatsby was an early gag that originated with Ethans obsession [watching video's of people doing crazy things in mobility scooters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1owweBRXABQ&t=5619s ). It made its first appearance on [Podcast #136](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulfHGdz6KB8&t=3881s) and made its office debut on [Podcast #142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IS3dVekCXw&t=2s) *

AB DID THAT, EVERYONE SAW THAT
------------------------------------------------------------------
Love bot would continue to get the ever living shit beat out of it, and in one memorable moment on [H3TV #10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs9bSkstX9s&t=8454s) Love was bullied by AB, who was promptly caught RED HANDED. Creating one of the most memorable and commonly used sound bites in the show!

Eventually, Love Bot would suffer a grevious wound, and would be decommissioned from the show in early 2022. 

The Foot War
--------------------------
In the summer of 2020, Ethan started gaining traction on the popular site WikiFeet.com. Fans were dumping 5 star ratings into his feet picture, which somehow propelled him ABOVE 5 stars [getting as high as a 6.93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfPmKCcl_Gg&t=90s), and eventually reaching it's climax in 2021 when Wikifeet forced Ethan (and only Ethan) to not be able to go over a 5 star rating, plummeting him in the rankings.

Love was not willing to take this sitting down and [gathered fans on Twitter](https://twitter.com/H3Out/status/1393271271224451075?s=20) to perform a cunning stealth mission to get Ethan back as #1 on WikiFeet - If Ethan could not go above 5 stars, we would just have to bring everyone else below 5 stars. 

Eventually the mission was successful and Ethan once again reigned supreme on the website, but this victory would be short lived and on [After Dark #37](https://youtu.be/SaC97huq9Ss?t=882) Ethan announced that he was banned off the website entirely. The war was over. The foot soldiers had lost.

On [After Dark #40](https://youtu.be/uvc-dX0fG3s?t=1678) Love announced that we had created a website, [EthansFeet.com](https://ethansfeet.com/), in monument to those sweet sweet grippers.

The Compliment...Off?
-----------------------------------------
On Off the Rails #4 the crew put together a segment where they would tell each other compliments and try not to laugh. The first person to laugh would be the loser. In a great achievement of fortitude and strength, Love was deemed unlaughable and took the victory.
Round 1: [Love vs. Zach](https://youtu.be/iBXtS72EGcM?t=4626)
Round 2: [Love vs. Ethan](https://youtu.be/iBXtS72EGcM?t=5295)
Round 3: [Love vs. Ian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBXtS72EGcM&t=6014s)

The Ryan Kavanaugh Situation
----------------------------------------------------------
In the midst of the Ryan Kavanaugh drama a meme was born that Ryan kinda looks like Harvey Weinstein, the writing was on the wall, the public is confused. On [Off the Rails #15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sQZ8G_h3U&t=6821s) Ethan and Love annouced that they had created a solution to this problem - https://doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com/. The public rejoiced! *Finally, we can breath again* one user said.

Since its inception the site has been shown to a multitude of guests:
[Bobby Lee & Khalyla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlPCUpYrMis&t=3626s)
[Anthony Fantano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PqE7QhzyXM&t=3745s)
[iDubbbz and Anisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68UMkX4Z08c&t=8214s)
[Amouranth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj2UXQ0jOy4&t=11574s)
[Hasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG7iuZnNLYE&t=1572s)
[Kurtis Conner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwSmgbQR9PA&t=5621s)

And a [fan video](https://youtu.be/AoBAiEK2Hug?t=9359) made by [Cauldron Convo's](https://www.youtube.com/@KaylaLove) was even watched on stream

Of course, ~~Harvey Weinstein~~ Ryan Kavanaugh would not take this sitting down, and on [Off the Rails #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QobESzsbh6M&t=592s) he would file a third lawsuit against Ethan and try to get the site taken down. He would not succeed, and the site remains active to this day.

2022
---------
In December of 2021 on [H3TV #19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev37IedFjMU&t=11241s) it was announced that love would be coming to America! There was much rejoicing from both the crew and fans alike! 

Love Arrives in America
--------------------------------------------
And on [H3TV #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHrEyuHHM9U&t=1460s) he would arrive in person, dawning a sword and his traditional Swedish garb. It was a a sight to behold.

For almost 3 months (From January 17 - April 4) Love blessed us with his soft fleshy body, before ~~being deported~~ leaving willingly back to Sweden, where he remains to this day. But his time here was not wasted!

He got to try all sorts of Fast Food:
- [Taco bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCJkzvMEy0&t=6741s)
- [Jollibee](https://youtu.be/auPJ1GsFOSg?t=3090)
- And many others throughout his stay

But of course, he also [brought Swedish Candy](https://youtu.be/sHrEyuHHM9U?t=7139)for everyone to try! Giving us this amazing Ethan moment -  [THE SUPER SALT](https://youtu.be/sHrEyuHHM9U?t=7580)

He also [stole a Pete Davidson cutoff](https://youtu.be/auPJ1GsFOSg?t=6372) from Olivia while he was here.

On [Off the Rails #27](https://youtu.be/9oj17cM1UPQ?t=175) he was promptly kicked out of an IKEA.

But eventually Love had to head back to Sweden. He said goodbye on [H3TV #30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulmY5h0M4co&t=2806s) in a hilarious segment that spawned a miriad of sound bites that use Loves 'American' accent. There's genuinely too many sound bites to recount, so I suggest just giving the segment a watch!

Pokimane
------------------
With Love back in Sweden and Love Bot decomissioned, he found himself confined to a screen behind AB, which has led to its own share of drama.

But with this newfound screen, a newfound love had also presented itself. In the form of Pokimane - And a picture of her dawned atop his screen, to which Ethan points out on [Off the Rails #44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeQ9CPU8SA&t=6079s)

And then, on September 2, Loves dreams come true. Pokimane comes onto the show as a guest! Love knows he has to prove himself and so he makes a plea to the crew - [Bring back Love Bot](https://youtu.be/Mx9j5GHn21o?t=991), just this once.

With his wits about him, he builds up the courage to give [his crush a gift](https://youtu.be/Mx9j5GHn21o?t=1426), to which she gracefully accepts, and now [presents in the background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfbwSHBOho&t=1483s) of her streams.


The Ninja Redemption Arc
------------------------------------------------------
The Ninja redemption arc is a long story and arguous story, of which Love played multiple key parts in!

It all begins with the crew playing Fortnite, to which they begin to watch Ninja's streams and they begin backing him. Love calls him Ninya, and the name sticks. Zach explains on [Off the Rails #35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNiIRTDfch0&t=1278s). And in [Off the Rails #40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue2zpTPkthg&t=9663s)  most of the crew comes out as Ninya stans.

Back in 2018, on [Podcast #63](https://youtu.be/s12qaVEyW14) Ethan had Ninja on the podcast. Unfortunately, since then there have been a few times that Ethan has called him out at various moment. Once it came out that the crew was stanning him, people began to spam Ninja's stream with love from H3. Which led to a heartfelt moment on [Off the Rails #44](https://youtu.be/ADeQ9CPU8SA?t=2838). 

Love wasted no time, it was clear that the beef had to be resolved, and so he immediately got Ninya to shout him out one of his streams! [H3TV #44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tiiER1zHfE&t=735s)

Followed by the rest of the crew getting shoutouts as well. [Off the Rails #44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADeQ9CPU8SA&t=3288s)

And eventually, [Ethan talks with Ninja](https://youtu.be/C6jBBUEx6fQ?t=8941) and Ninya [sends the crew G-Fuel](https://youtu.be/XTU2hHPXVos?t=9465) as a sign of good will! Things were good, peaceful... For a time. 

But a few months later, Ethan was banned of Twitter for making a parody account of Elon Musk, which he found hilarious. Ninja disagreed, and a new beef was formed.  [Off the Rails #54](https://youtu.be/BraYUdc3YRo?t=368)

Ninja made some antisemetic remarks that Ethan not down with, and hatred once again began to bubble [Off the Rails #54](https://youtu.be/XTU2hHPXVos?t=9465)

And just as quickly as Love fought for Ninya, just months ago, he turned on him in the most hilarious fashion and began to back Ethan, calling Ninja a dumbass idiot on [After Dark #90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvGqpAcXNqo&t=6219s). While the rest of the crew was trying to calm Ethans wrath, [Love was stoking the flames](https://youtu.be/OKvP1K2OuLk?t=1885). Ninja has not yet commented.

And of course, many many sound bites came from this little era in the H3 Podcast history. [After Dark #92](https://youtu.be/GgwXXGtUCgE?t=10235)

Dumbass Idiot
----------------------------
Love calling Ninja a dumbass idiot is not exclusive to Ninja, at this point it has more of less become his catch phrase. There are many moments of him doing it and it's never not hilarious. Like that time he called a dog a dumbass. [H3TV #57](https://youtu.be/Y0idXvAgs6Q?t=692)

Background Antics
----------------------------------
On a more general note, Love is always up to wacky shinanigans in the background of the the live streams. It's almost like a Where's Waldo situation at this point, and it's always fun to try and catch him goofing around. 
- [Filling his screen with nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19qnDm2tDs&t=4370s)
- Flies in the studio, [Love came prepared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRJLngUhhno&t=1085s)
- And many other situations that come up in almost every episode.

Streamer
-------------------
Lastly, love does some hilarious things on his [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/yungfika). A few of which have been brought up on the show, such as
- Love gets arrested on stream: https://youtu.be/pUAWStsw8jY?t=7727
- Love has beef with McDonalds: https://youtu.be/IFfxLKkYh8Q?t=10515

I hope this was helpful in getting you accustomed to some of the lore surrounding Love! I know I had to miss some things, so if you have anything to add please leave a comment!
