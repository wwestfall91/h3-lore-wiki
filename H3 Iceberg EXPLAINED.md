This my my first post (of a few) that aims to give insight to the lore presented on the [100+ MEGA Iceberg post](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/11ke5g9/mega_iceberg_chart_100_entries_12_layers_h3/) that was posted last week. I try to be as thorough as I can, but when we're talking about 6 years of content it's practically impossible to include every single piece of content surrounding certain posts.

If you notice any type-o's or incorrect links let me know - This post is huge and so I certainly missed some things. Hope this post is helpful!

This covers the first 4 layers. LET'S GO!

## LAYER 1

### **Peace and Love**

In the summer of 2020 Ethan and Hila watched a video made by Ringo Starr. The video declared that after the 20th of October he would not be accepting any more fan mail. He ushered his fans *please, do not send any fan mail to ANY address. He has TOO MUCH to do. No more fanmail. Anyway, peace and love, peace and love.* Ethan loved the peace and love attitude and started quoting it. It would become a staple on the show and among fans, and led to Ethan eventually re-enacting the entire video.

### **Frenemies**

A web show hosted by Ethan Klein and Trish Paitus. There's simply too much to cover in-depth here, but I think we all know how the rest of this goes.

### **The Crew**

The well oiled machine that keeps everything running! Current members consist of Dan, Ian, Zach, AB, Love, Sam, Olivia, Cameron, and Lena. I created a post with more specific information about everyone on the crew, so check that out if you want to know more!

[The H3 Crew EXPLAINED](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/11px69r/every_h3_crew_member_explained_timestamps_included/?ref=share&ref_source=link).

### **Foot Soldiers**

In the March of 2020 Ethan would host a segment on the show about wikifeet.com, a popular website that hosts feet pictures of celebrities. This would lead to fans mass-rating Ethan's feet a 5 star, leading to Ethan being #1 on the site, and the title 'Foot Soldiers' given to fans of the show.  By May of 2021 Ethans grippers would reach an all time high rating of 7.42 out of 5. However, mods began to catch wind of these shenanigans and Ethan would be banned from the site entirely, his page, *deleted*. However, the name Foot Soldiers are still echoed across these dusty halls to this day.

### **FAMILY**

A video of Vin Diesel lookalikes repeatedly saying "FAMILY" surfaced and was watched on the Pod. After this the crew and chat began chanting 'FAMILY' throughout the show. While it's not done as much these days, it does still prop up from time-to-time.

## LAYER 2

### **White Claw Gabe**

White Claw Gabe is a famous Tik Tok personality that LOVES FRIDAY BABY!!! Ethan started watching his clips on the show and eventually had him call in. This eventually led to him calling in every Friday, and he has been a staple on Friday shows ever since!

### **H2.9**

For a time there was a running joke on the show that they were going to hit 3 million subscribers *this* episode. Fans would subscribe during the episode, getting them over 3 million subs, and then unsub, brining them back down to 2.9m. Eventually subs would just start to continuously drop and have been dropping ever since. Viewers started calling it the H2.9 Podcast because of this. At time of posting they have 2.87m. H2.8, anyone?

### **The Jersey Outlaw**

HOOO BOY. Where to even start with this one... Jimmie Lee is a crazy dentist gone comedian whose stage name is The Jersey Outlaw. Before the Podcast a video was made about him on the Ethan and Hila YouTube channel, and eventually he was brought onto the Podcast as a guest. Some considered his episode to be the worst of all time. However, in recent years Jimmie has come back onto the show. While he himself is controversial and not particularly funny, the interactions the crew and guests have with him are hilarious. To go into his entire lore would be an entire post in and of itself, but here's a bunch of clips (oldest to newest) if you wanna dig in.

### **Pride Minute**

Jordan Peterson once said that Pride Month is *too damn long*. And so, Pride Minute was created so that that we get to be ourselves for no more than 60 seconds! Many Pride Minutes have been had with, and for, many people. And lets not forget that sweet holographic foil card!

### **Hairline King**

Allllll the way back in 2017 Ethan discussed how great his hairline is. Too great, perhaps. In 2020, he decided to put his face in a machine and it came back with two determinations.

1. Ethan UGLY AS FUCK (The machine said it not me!!)
2. His hairline is dope af.

So the machine agree's - His one redeeming attribute is that sick hairline! From there Ethan became the hairline king, absorbing the hairline of his enemies to make his hairline everlasting... *Or is it?*

### **Prolapsed Anus**

Over the summer of 2022 Howie Mandel posted a picture of ~~pudding on a mans ass~~ a man fully prolapsing his anus on TikTokfor the world to see. Ethan LOVED this and ran with it to the end of the earth. He showed it to all his guests, and eventually confronted Howie about it. He confronted Howie about it on HIS podcast, and when Howie came on the H3 Podcast, a man called in and prolapsed LIVE ON AIR for Howie. Shortly after a prolapse tribute was made for Silent Library and... Well... Others have witnessed it since.

### **LoveBot**

Lovebot was created so that Love, who lives in Sweden, could be apart of the show. It was remotedly controlled by Love where it got the shit beat out of it constantly by ~~The Crew~~ AB and AB alone.

### **Steamy Awards**

A yearly segment that is meant to be a parody of the *Streamy* awards. The co-host(s) change every year, and are cursed to insanity if they take on the role. Good luck this year to our latest co-hosts, Tana and Jeff.

### **Triller Lawsuits**

In April of 2021 Jake Paul had his fight against Ben Askren, to which Ethan joked about pirating the fight on Instagram. He then showed a clip of the fight in the following podcast, to which Triller decided to combat by suing Ethan for rebroadcasting the event. A few months later, Triller sued Hila, and a few months after that a third lawsuit was filed. This topic is a post in itself, so I'm not going to get anymore detailed.

### **800 DPI**

No one knew for awhile, but Dan's mouse has a voice, and it's sexy as hell. Many in the chat thirst over Dan's mouse. Ethan also got sick and impersonated the mouse, so there's that too if you're into it.

### **5%**

During Frenemies Trisha often complained about how Ethan took 5% of payment for the show. After Frenemies ended, Trisha's sister would make a video talking about him taking that 5%. Joe Rogan also has a say in the 5% fiasco.

### **Scorpion Chair**

In 2021 the Podcast moved to a new studio. Dan used this as leverage to try and get a newer, more badass, chair. There were various iterations of what the chair would be, but in the end it was the STEEL STRIKER, forged in the deepest recesses of a neutron star.

### **WAN**

In July 2022 Ethan would watch some of Jidion's awful prank videos, leading to a response from Jidion himself. In the response Jidion was highly critical of Ethan, however, he took a liking to Dan and called him W DAN, or WAN for short.

### **FLOCKA**

### **Ethan is 42**

Ethan was in denial on his 40th birthday, believing he was only 37. By his 42nd birthday he was still in denial. The crew often has to remind him that he is, in fact, 42 years old.

### **Majority Female Audience**

Back in the day the show was watched primarily by men. However, after Frenemies there was an uptick in women viewers. As of September 2022 the audience was 60% women.

### **Shoutout to his family**

In May of 2020 a famous DJ named David Guetta made a tribute song to George Floyd's family, starting the song by saying "shoutout to his family". They watched it on the podcast and it became a very popular soundbite, eventually winning the first ever soundbite tournament! The channel also recently made a lore video about this, so check that out!

### **AUDIO AUDIO AUDIO**

A popular soundbite that originated from when Jimmie Lee, Zach, and Cameron went out on the streets of LA. A similar soundbite has spawned from Jimmy saying this on a Zoom call with minimal service.

### **AB Boxing Matches**

AB fought (and lost) to Hundar of Muscle party in Creator Clash 2022. Both Hundar and Luckyboy (ABs boxing coach) were guests on the Podcast to talk about his fight. This year AB will be fighting Dad.

### **Joker Brain**

One of the oldest ongoing jokes on the show. It started in December of 2020 when Zach declared he had a 'Joker Brain'. Since then merch has been sold surrounding Joker Brain, a Joker Brain NFT was created, and Zach has dressed up as the Joker multiple times. However, in September of 2022 Zach had his Joker Brain title revoked. It was given to Lena - The true joker brain of the crew. Zach does not agree.

### **AB's Burrito**

During an ad read for HelloFresh, a picture of a burrito that AB had made was put on the screen. However, it was suppose to be a quesadilla. This prompted input from the chat to explain how much AB fucked up the recipe, and the meme has remained ever since.

### **P&P**

A Tik Tok Lawyer that Ethan stumbled upon and found absolutely hilarious. Since then P&P has called into the show multiple times, and even made an appearance on the live show. LETS GOO!

### **Godfather Impression**

Possibly the oldest impression on the show. It started with humble beginnings, and eventually Zach added music to the segment. Today Zach is often the instigator, and will play the music to get Ethan riled up.

### **OTR Intro's**

The Wednesday show of the Podcast is titled Off the Rails (OTR). This began when Hila stopped being on every episode to focus on Teddy Fresh. There are two intros that need to be addressed, which are:
1. Zach's soundbite intros - These started off small and have ballooned in scope in size, even getting video added as of 6 months ago.
2. Skits - There are a fair amount of skits that are played at the start of the episodes. I'll add a few here.

### **Weights in Fish**

In October of 2022 a TikTok went viral that revealed a team fo fisherman cheating by putting weights in fish to increase their numbers. This led to a hilarious soundbite that is often used on the show.

[THEY GOT WEIGHTS IN FISH](https://youtu.be/NI1UG6QGdr8&t=9592s)

### **AB's Origin Story**

AB started out as the YouTuber known as Starkilla. He created a video defending Ethan and it got very little views until about a year later when it started taking off. Ethan got sight of the video, and ended up asking AB to join the crew!

[Starkilla video](https://youtu.be/vNBZ-dif6Y0) | [AB Joins the Crew](https://youtu.be/qsgyaVvDKCg&t=2424s)

### **Bomb Threats**

*cough* Ethan said someone should bomb the NRA and the episode got banned *cough*

### **Zilly Zonka**

When Ethan was trying Mr. Beast's chocolate bars on the show the crew came up with an ellaborate ploy to create a fake golden ticket, and a fake website to submit the ticket on, so that Ethan could get ZILLY ZONK'D BRUH. He made a re-appearance later when AB and Ian made a fake cryptocurrency.

### **20 Billion Dollar Compound**

The Leftovers set started as a 3 million dollar set, but with each episode Ethan continues to pump more and more of his life savings into its defenses. Today it is an entire compound with state of the art defenses worth 20 BILLION dollars in total.

### **Dr. Idz**

A medical doctor who fueled Ethan's Coke Zero addiction by telling him that Diet Coke is good for him. Has a TikTok channel where he debunks medical misinformation. Has called into the show multiple times for various different topics. Is a certified stud.

### **DoesRyanKavanaughLookLikeHarveyWeinstein.com**

In the midst of the Ryan Kavanaugh drama a meme was born that Ryan kinda looks like Harvey Weinstein, the writing was on the wall, the public was confused! So Ethan and Love created a solution to this problem - [doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com](https://doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com/). The public rejoiced! _Finally, we can breath again_ one user said. 

Of course, ~~Harvey Weinstein~~ Ryan Kavanaugh would not take this sitting down and in December of 2021 he would file a third lawsuit against Ethan and try to get the site taken down. He would not succeed, however, and the site remains active to this day and has been shown to many guests!

### **Ethan Klein Body Double**

In 2022 the H3 Podcast was nominated for a streamy award once again. In the past Ethan has been very staunchly against the streamies due to his pent up aggression to Jay Shetty being a superior podcast host. However, this year was going to be different. He would play by their rules. He would attend the streamies himself. He would gather the troops. He would storm into that establishment and claim his rightful place atop their throne of lies. Aaaaand he sent a body double. *And he kept him around to do mundane tasks too!**

### **Throast**

A wiki moderator that was dragged into Ryan Kavanaugh drama. In November of 2021  a wikipedia user named *RK777713* began erasing the 'Controversial' section of Ryan Kavanaugh's Wikipedia page. When mods noticed, a heated discussion between them began, inevitably leading to the mods banning the account. 

It was suspected that this account could be Ryan Kavanaugh, and this theory would only be further proven when Kav Kav would grow increasingly unhinged in the following months. One such bounty was Ryan putting out a tweet stating that he would reward 25k to anyone who could prove that Ethan was Throast.

### **Chestnutgate**

Ethan was late on getting on the anucatittawan train, but what he lacked in time he made up for in quantity and he became obssessed with anuc's cover of *Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire*, playing the clip at various moments throughout the late January 2023 shows. However, Chestnuts would be forever tainted when Ethan told Zach to play it overtop a very emotional video by qtcinderella. The entire situation was met with great backlash and was dubbed *Chestnut Gate*.

### **R Kelly Passport Song**

One of the longest running jokes on the Podcast. Back in March of 2019 Ethan presented a video of R. Kelly trying to recruit women in Ethiopia to come back to America with him. While R. Kelly is now in jail for sex trafficking charges there's not denying the song is a bop. Ethan sings it multiple times a year and multiple skits and hilarious moments have spawned from the song.

### **That's not Fraud**

Back in 2019 a documentary about the disastrous Fire Festival landed on Netflix. Ja Rule was famously apart of the scam, and while trying to save face during the fallout he proudly declared *That's not Fraud. I would call that... Uhhhh... False Advertising*. To this day whenever fraud is talked about on the show you can be sure that Ja Rule will be there to add to the conversation.

Ethan's a disgusting FREAK who chews into the microphone. The Chew Zone was created to help alleviate that. It helped a little, I guess.

### **Mayo Meme's**

For a time mayonaisse was a consistent theme throughout on the H3 Podcast's. Sure, today you might hear about *mayoing up Dans Dome*, or perhaps the Thanksgiving food will include homage to the simpler times. Times when Mayo Meme's reigned supreme. And they all began in an unexpected place... With Horsey Sauce.

### **Brad the Bull**

Ryan Kavanaugh is many things. Among those, he is a man who loves to be CUCKED. Brad the Bull is a mighty man that did just that and bulled his wife. Well, ex-wife.

Craigsmas began in December of 2020. It began with Ian trying to buy the crew ridiculous items for CHEAP on Craigs List. It has become a yearly tradition, the items each year getting increasingly more cursed.

### **Content Court**

While it isn't a segment that happens so much these days, there was a time when Content Courts were dropping on the regular. It consisted of the crew in a courtroom with a plaintiff and a defendant. They would pick a content creator and present their cases on whether or not they should be charged. But Judge Ethan is not easily convinced.

She gave a presentation about the problem's surrounding them, and how we can help, and was soon after dubbed *Donnarch* by the fans. Subsequently, her fans went by *The Donnarchs*

The feeding window was a failed attempt for Ethan to lose weight. The plan was simple, if he only allowed himself to eat food a few hours a day and fasted for the rest, then the weight would come right off! Right?

Rory Hicks dwells deep below the surface, sending communications up to the Podcast via superchats. Rory will often let us know what the mole people are up to below the surface, and many a time they have been ready to take up arms for the good of the Podcast!

### **Barefoot Brothers Drive**

Have you ever wanted to take drive barefoot, video tape it, and make money doing so? Then C-Man, and his website, https://www.barefootbrothersdrive.com/, is your ticket! In October of 2021 a peculiar ad surfaced on YouTube with this exact business offer. A man named Liam would take up the offer, and call into the Podcast discussing the drama that happened because of it. Eventually C-Man and Liam would confront one another on the Podcast, and it would be revealed that Liam was trolling the entire time. As an act of good faith, Love would make a website called https://www.barefootbrothersdrivesmotorcycle.com/ that contained a single video of Love riding a motorcycle in his barefeet. The site is still active, but the video is no longer available.

### **Ben Affleck's Back Tattoo**

Back in 2019 Ethan showed Hila Ben Afflecks back tattoo, and she declared it to the *the worst tattoo of all time*. This became a re-occurring segment on the show where Ethan would show Hila bad tattoo's to see if they could find an even worse tattoo. For years Ben Afflecks tattoo would reign supreme as the worst tattoo, but eventually it would be de-throned by none other than Ed Sheeran.

### **"This Smells Like my Butthole" candle**

In January of 2020 Gwenneth Paltrow began selling a 'Smells Like My Vagina Candle'. They bought one to smell on the show, and it just smelt like a nice candle. Ethan thought it would be funny to create a 'Smells Like My Butthole' candle, and soon after they began working with a company to make this come to life. In December of 2020 the candle would be sold, raising $8,000 for prostate cancer.

### **GERD Gang**

Ethan has GERD, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, which causes stomach acid to repeatedly flow backwards into the tube connnecting your mouth to your stomach. This causes him to hack and cough fairly often on the show. But Ethan is not alone, and many in the comments shared the sentiment of having GERD. They were declared GERD Gang!

### **DD Megadoodoo**

This is referring to a viral moment from a news anchor who was caught stumbling to pronounce someone's name live on the air. For some reason all that she could muster was DD Megadoodoo. This became a popular soundbite that is often used when Ethan incorrectly names someone on the Podcast..

### **Vape God NFT**

In March of 2021 Ethan and Crew got into the NFT game. Each member of the crew got their own custom NFT. The Vape God NFT is a one of a kind minted NFT that had an entire episode dedicated to it's sale. A bidding war broke out and in the end it sold for 33 ETH ($60,769.50 at the time).

### Gatsby

An early gag that originated with Ethans obsession with watching video's of people doing crazy things in mobility scooters, which led to Ethan wanting to get a mobility scooter of his own. There would be a stream where chat got to choose what scooter Ethan should buy and The Gatsby would be the victor! For a brief period of time guests would ride the scooter onto the set at the start of the show, however this was short lived due to Bobby Lee being an absolute maniac. which would end up being The Gatsby.  Many skits would include The Gatsby, but it has begun to appear less and less over the years.

When Mr. Beasts feastibles chocolate were first hitting the shelf they tried them on the Podcast. This led to a Zilly Zonka bit that required Love to make a fake website so that Ethan could get ZONK'D.

She had a YouTube channel where she would film herself cruising around in public on her scooter to record evidence of people mistreating her as a handicapped person. Unfortunately it would be revealed in recent years that Mobility Mary has passed. Ethan and crew attempted to get her scooter, but unfortunately missed the mark on that one.

### Braco

The stare of Braco is a magical thing. Look into his eyes, child. He is waiting for you.

### Belle Delphine Spit Jar

In the summer of 2019 Belle Delphine was all the rage, and she sent the H3 Podcast a special surprise - A jar of spit. Throughout the years it would be smelt because they are disgusting, and when they moved to the new office a mystery revealed itself - The spit simply disappeared from its jar.

### Ghost Stories

In the early days of the Podcast Ethan and Hila would always ask their guests if they had any paranormal experiences that they would like to share. Fans loved this segment but Ethan, being extremely skeptical, really didn't care and always found the stories bullshit. Ethan would eventually explain that this was the reason for them stopping.

### Zach's Lawn Shit

Zach once had to shit so bad he pulled his car over while driving and shit on some dude's lawn. He would later admit to taking a picture of said lawn shit.

*The episode of Zach talking about taking a picture was on After Dark #46, which was famously removed from YouTube by Keemstar. Because of this I cannot provide a link. If anyone has a mirror I'd love to get it added!

### I Gotta Pee So Bad

On episode #106 of the Podcast Ian declared to the world *I Gotta Pee So Bad*. It was the start of the Ian soundbites and has become one of the most famous soundbites on the Podcast.

### Inspired by the Howard Stern Show

It has been mentioned multiple times that Ethan has taken a lot of inspiration from the Howard Stern Show, and many of the members of the crew love the show as well.

### Dr. Faddel Deleted Segment

It was long suspected that Jimmie Lee has Hysterionic Personality Disorder, and so they decided to have a doctor call into the Podcast to diagnose him LIVE ON AIR! This would prove to be a bad call on the doctors part, and he has since gotten in huge trouble for doing this. It is presumed that the segment was deleted for this reason.

### Ian the Intern Powerpoints

In the earlier days of the Podcast Ian was known for creating detailed PowerPoints about various topics. While this segment didn't last too long, they are hilarious, and hold a special place in many long-time fans' hearts.

### Patrice Wilson Countdown Stream

Patrice Wilson is a music producer who wrote Rebecca Black's song Friday (along with many others). In the early days of the Podcast Ethan would often rag on him for being a creep. In November of 2017 Patrice would post a livestream with a countdown to December 1st with h3h3 in the title. Ethan would show this to Post Malone on Podcast #39, and afterwards fans would point out that the live stream has began to change. This led to a whole series of creepy events that would genuinely freak Ethan out.

### The BacH3lor

Ethan and Hila are long time fans of the Bachelor series, which led them to create a series of segments called the BacH3lor. Ian would be the bachelor looking for love, and he would immediately break the rules and drama would unfold between Ethan and him. There were only 2 segments before the show was cancelled. They tried again later with Trish as the BacH3lorette. It once again failed, and was dubbed a cursed segment. Ironically, both Trisha and Ian found their current SO's through these segments, but not at all in the way they were suppose to.

### Shoenice

Shoenice is a YouTuber best known for eating really weird thinks (ie: Stick of deodorant, raw bacon, etc.). The relationship between Shoe and the Podcast has been a rollercoaster and whether Shoenice likes or hates Ethan and the Crew truly seems to depend on the day. He's been brought onto the pod multiple times in the past, but lately has not been mentioned much.

### Anal Fissures

In a time long before anal prolapses were even mentioned, a conversation around anal fissures would begin to unfold. Zach would pipe in and discuss the surgical process of fixing anal fissures. This would turn out to be entirely incorrect, and Zach would apologize for the misinformation.

### Leonard Katzman

Ethan's grandpa. He left Ethan's grandma when Ethans dad was very young, and went off to become a pretty famous film producer. He never re-connected with Ethan's father.

### Creedance Clearwater Curse

Zach has a phobia against the band Clarence Clearwater Revival. He believes that hearing their song or mentioning their name gives everyone bad luck. He is completely serious, and the crew often makes gags out of it.

### Lil Tracy Beef

Back when the song Old Town Road was the most popular song on the planet a discussion arose around whether it was stolen from Lil Tracy. Ethan said no, and that Lil Tracy needs to stfu and deal with it. Lil Tracy then wrote a series of negative tweets at Ethan. It's all made even funnier that every time he is brought up Ethan never remembers who he is.

### Fatburgs

Before Ethan got a bidet, he used to swear by flushable baby wipes at the end of his poops. But one day he learned about fatburgs - A buildup of sewage that happens all over the country. A large contributing factor to this is flushable baby wipes. It turns out flushable does not mean decomposable, and they build up into these horrific creatures. He has since sworn off baby wipes and spreads the good word to anyone still using them.

### The Regula Shmegula

After Ethan Bradberry fell off he began making videos about... Coffee? Honestly just watch the first video, this one  cannot be explained with words. Ethan and Hila later go down th Bradberry hole to discuss further what the hell is happening.

### Goof Gang

As mentioned earlier, the Podcast takes a lot of inspiration from The Howard Stern show. Good Gang is a play on words for Howard Sterns Wack Pack - A group of interesting personalities that often appear on the show. It was something they mentioned in the earlier years of the pod, such as with Shoenice, but the term itself never really stuck.

### Sharky's Giftcard

In the early days of the podcast Ethan let Ian use his car for a day. In response, Ian got Ethan a $40 gift card to Sharky's Woodfired Mexican Grill. This gesture of good faith spiraled into an absolute fiasco, and as a running gag the crew often gives Sharky's giftcards as gifts to each other.

### The Drunk Stream

On Podcast #29 Ethan, Jacksfilms, and Erik all got quite drunk, and Ethan mentioned his Podcast with iDubbbz where he said some derogatory terms. He not ony mentioned these terms, but did not censor himself when saying them. The episode has since been edited for obvious reasons, and Ethan has apologized many times for his remarks. This is best showcased on the Gokanaru episode.

### Blocked on Twitter by OJ Simpson

In June of 2019 Ethan couldn't stop watching OJ Simpson on Twitter. He relentelessly dug into OJ for being, you know, a murderer, and eventually got blocked by him. The popular soundbite *Hey Twitter World, this is Yours Truly* came from these videos.

### n****** f******

Ethan has had a storied past with some dark moments. In an early episode with iDubbbz they had a discussion about how a racial slur is just a word and they should be able to use it... And so they did use it. And they used a gay slur afterwards. Not a good moment. The episode has since been edited for obvious reasons, and Ethan has apologized many times for his remarks. This is best showcased on the Gokanaru episode.

### Bill Burr Episode 1

Notoriously considered one of the worst episodes of the Podcast. This was still pretty early on in Ethans career as a Podcast host and he was still getting his footing. Bill Burr is known be a tough interviewer, and Ethan could not hold up. This led to a lot of awkward moments between the two, and Ethan discusses the effect that it had on him later. Bill Burr has since come back on with much better reception.

### The Wildcard's Identity

Back during Ian's time on the BacH3lor he famously began talking to a girl who was not on the show. She was dubbed *The Wildcard* and would inevitably be the reason Ian pushed to get the segment cancelled. It has since been revealed that Sam is the wildcard, and they have been dating happily since.

### Cody Padrino

Cody Padrino, long-time friend of Jeff Wittek, has become a friendly character on the show, but this was not always the case. When Jeff and Ethan we're not on such friendly terms Cody took Ethan's insults *VERY* seriously. This led to Cody making a video of him driving by Ethan's house and threatening him.
