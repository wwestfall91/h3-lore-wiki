The writing is on the wall, THE PUBLIC IS CONFUSED ABOUT DAN! This guide its here to help with all the TOP Dan moments that have spanned the entire podcast!

You all have been going CRAZY with the soundbite requests, KEEP THEM COMING!! My main focus was getting the skeleton for the crew pages up so I can expand on that, but I did manage to add 16 new soundbites to the mix!

Additionally, you've all been diligent about catching bugs as well! I've fixed a couple dozen soundbites that wouldn't play, and a handful of bugged out links/categories on the Iceberg. Please continue to DM me if you notice anymore!

Hope you all enjoy ✌❤
