Great opening moment - [Dans standing ovation](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/s/XfypdH8bbk)
Dan, the crew member with the longest running tenor on the H3 Podcast. Dan the Magician. Dan the Hater. Dan the Contrarian. Dan *The Producer*. It's often said that the H3 Podcast is a well oiled machine, and it's safe to say that Dan is the Mechanic whose keeping this engine running smooth. So sit back, take a load off, and get ready for a huge freaking wall of text. Come with me as we go *down the Dannit Hole*
# BEFORE THE SHOW
Over the 7 years that Dan has been on the Podcast, many stories have been told of *the past times.* A time before Ethan and Hila, goofs and gaffs, peace and love. What shaped Dan into the bald headed man that he has become today? 

Well here he is as a [tiny little baby](https://youtu.be/HbATtwgldBw?t=4201).
Here's Dan, [lover of Megaman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfZM73q7NOc&t=1808s)
And here's what he looked like [High School](https://youtu.be/gCt816XqnQ4?t=1943)

# EARLY SHOW
Early on in the show Ethan was looking to cut back on editing time, and they brought Dan on as the shows switcher to cut the camera to whoever was talking. However, his expertise in other area's became quickly apparent! It was at this point that Ethan brought Dan on as the first full-time employee and *Dan the Producer* was official! 

Ethan and Hila explain additional details [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/169526220?collection=tCXPvh_s1RSQOA&t=02h47m05s)
## First Mention
The first time Dan was mentioned was on [Podcast #11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEP_YdWei0Y&t=3705s) when he, funnily enough, was complaining about Ethan chewing into the microphone. 

## First Appearance
His first appearance was on [H3 Podcast #16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4k1gEC0800&t=4865s) and on the [following episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W555pdLeI_I&t=5182s) he had his very first segment - In the News!
## In the News
In the news was a very early segment on the show in which Dan would come on and give us some news segments. It was a fairly short lived segment that lived for only 5 episodes.

# LAYING THE FOUNDATION
Dan is a man of many talents, and in the early days Dan WAS the crew. All those responsibilities that are separated amongst the 9 crew members today we're ALL DAN. 

Soundbites? Dan.

Research? Dan.

Fact Checking? Dan.

On top of that he was still very much apart of the comedy part of the show, being in gags a plenty! And none of these are even touching on how every new piece of equipment that was added to the show fell onto his shoulder to get it setup. And not only did he succeed at this, he did so at an INHUMAN PACE. Lets take soundbites, for example.
## Soundbites
On [Podcast #15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSZYeL84t90&t=6120s) Ethan had this funny idea to get a soundboard to play soundbites, on the FOLLOWING episode it was done. Dan had the soundboard setup with a few soundbites at the ready. And so the [first ever soundbite on the H3 Podcast was dropped.](https://youtu.be/N4k1gEC0800?t=1733)

An early gag of the Podcast was Ethan saying the word "*fascinating*" all the time. The community would often [dog on him for his overusing of the word](https://youtu.be/AYWcC1fcMQw?t=4180), and an episode later Dan would drop the very first soundbite to spawn from the Podcast itself - [FASCINATING](https://youtu.be/rq8HL3jVy-M?t=143). The moment itself was a bit clunk, but it's an interesting insight to see the foundation being laid for what the show is today.

Dan would continue to drop soundbites for *over 60 episodes* before Zach was finally hired on [Podcast #85](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t4h0XWRnC4&t=479s) as the official sound lad!

## The Fact Checker
It wasn't long before Ethan started calling on Dan for every tidbit of information, and this man was *A MACHINE*. He was at the ready, gun drawn, wasting no time shedding light on any piece of information that Ethan was unsure of.

Catcher and the Rye conspiracy? [Dan knows](https://youtu.be/tr1Loa7r7sY?t=6922)

Podcast Phone Number? [Already setup and being shown on the screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0878tn4aw&t=129s)

"Whose the Famous *Price is Right* Lady"? [It's Vanna White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irVe0wQkMXg&t=1683s).  Does it matter that Ethan meant Wheel of Fortune? No, Dan knows the answer regardless. And the man doesn't even correct him. The man is a humble pie. Some even say the humblest.

These are over the course of three shows, but there are hundreds of moments just like these. Dan truly was solidifying himself as *The Voice of God*, as Ethan often referred to him as back then.

## Jack of All Trades
Over the coming episodes, Dan would prove himself to be the Jack of All trades. I'll let the clips speak for themselves, this man can, and did, do it all!

### First Mention
[Ethan Talking About How Great Dan Was Early On]

Early on in the show it became apparent to Ethan and Hila that they needed help. They didn't have the skills or know-how to create the show that they wanted to create. Their friend, [FIND FRIENDS NAME HERE], recommended Dan for the job, and the rest... Is history.

### First Appearance

### Dan Had Hair
Yes, it may be hard to believe but Dan actually had hair for a very long time on the podcast. Although it was almost always hidden beneath a hat or beanie, you can see here in an early episode - Our boy's got the goods.

### W-Dan, WAN

In July 2022 Ethan would watch some of Jidion's awful prank videos, leading to a response from Jidion himself. In the response Jidion was highly critical of Ethan, however, he took a liking to Dan and called him W DAN, or WAN for short.

### Bull Penis Staff
In September of 2022 Liver King was a guest on LeftOvers. In an attempt to live the primal lifestyle, Ethan and Hasan ate a bull penis. It was gross. Anyway, Sam put it that big ol dick in resin and made a cane for Dan with it.
