Additional moments of note:
Love asks about splash protection - https://reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/s/J1ND049GdF
AB Asks if Ethan's flushing anything else down the toilet - https://youtu.be/XhxNbAgQf6E?t=467
Zach asks Ethan if it's NOT the shit itself - https://youtu.be/MgwMZS-9MBg?t=10505

Ethan also insists on multiple occasions that it clogs BEFORE THE TOILET PAPER EVEN HITS. 

Ethan EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

As a fun additional into some Behind the Scenes action - Back in February the crew did not have hazard cone's to block off the bathroom. I repeat THEY DID NOT HAVE TRAFFIC CONES SPECIFICALLY FOR ETHAN'S SHIT BACK IN FEBRUARY. Now the question is... Were the traffic cones specifically bought SPECIFICALLY for Ethan's knarly shits? We may never know.
